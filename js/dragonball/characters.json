However, falling off a cliff gave him a brutal blow that although it almost killed him, it altered his memory and nullified all the violent instincts of his species, making him grow with a pure and kind heart, but retaining all the powers of his race. However, in the new continuity of Dragon Ball it is established that he was sent by his parents to Earth with the aim of surviving at all costs the destruction of his planet by Freeza. Later, Kakarot, now known as Son Goku, would become the prince consort of Mount Fry-pan and leader of the Z Warriors, as well as the greatest defender of Earth and Universe 7, managing to keep them safe from destruction on countless occasions, despite not considering himself a hero or savior.",
